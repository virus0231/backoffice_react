# NFR Assessment: 1.5

Date: 2025-09-27
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No authentication required for read-only dashboard
- Performance: CONCERNS - Synthetic data generation, no optimization indicators
- Reliability: PASS - Good error handling and retry logic implemented
- Maintainability: PASS - Strong test coverage and clean code structure

## Critical Issues

1. **Performance monitoring missing** (Performance)
   - Risk: No insight into actual load times or response performance
   - Fix: Add performance monitoring and real query optimization for production data

2. **Synthetic data in production endpoints** (Performance)
   - Risk: Performance characteristics don't reflect real database queries
   - Fix: Replace synthetic data generation with actual database queries

## Quick Wins

- Add performance timing logging: ~2 hours
- Implement response time monitoring: ~1 hour
- Add cache hit rate metrics: ~1 hour
