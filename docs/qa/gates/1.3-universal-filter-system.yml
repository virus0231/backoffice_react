gate_decision: CONCERNS
gate_rationale: |
  Story implementation is functionally complete with excellent test coverage (86%) and
  solid technical architecture. However, security concerns around missing authentication
  and rate limiting on filter endpoints present medium-risk exposure that should be
  addressed before production deployment.

quality_score: 75
risk_level: MEDIUM

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - Add rate limiting middleware to /api/filters/* endpoints (2 hours)
    - Implement authentication validation on filter API routes (4 hours)
    - Complete test coverage for FundsFilter component (3 hours)

  future:
    - Add performance monitoring for API response times
    - Implement error alerting beyond console logging
    - Consider data access controls based on user permissions

approval_conditions:
  - Security recommendations implemented before production deployment
  - Test coverage gaps addressed
  - Documentation updated with security considerations
