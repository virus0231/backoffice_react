# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Insights** (Nonprofit Fundraising Analytics Dashboard), including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined. The architecture specifically addresses the challenge of transforming raw phpMySQL database data into 15+ interactive analytics visualizations with exact FundraisUP interface replication.

## Starter Template Analysis

After reviewing your PRD and technical assumptions, this is a **greenfield Next.js project** with specific requirements for:
- Next.js 13+ with App Router architecture
- Direct phpMySQL database integration (no data migration required)
- Exact FundraisUP dashboard interface replication
- Recharts visualization library integration

**Decision: N/A - Greenfield project** with clear technical stack already defined in PRD requirements.
