# Story 1.5: Primary Revenue Dashboard (Three-Section Chart)

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** development director,
**I want** the main revenue dashboard with three distinct sections showing total raised, first installments, and one-time donations,
**so that** I can immediately understand our fundraising performance breakdown and identify revenue sources.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. "Raised" section with total revenue amount and donation count display matching FundraisUP styling
2. "First Installments" section showing new recurring donor revenue with count metrics
3. "One-time donations" section displaying single gift revenue and transaction count
4. Three synchronized Recharts area charts with blue gradient fills matching reference design
5. Shared date filtering and comparison overlay functionality across all three sections
6. Daily/Weekly view toggle affecting all three charts simultaneously
7. Responsive layout maintaining three-section structure on different screen sizes
8. Real-time data updates reflecting current filter selections

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story Dependencies:** This story requires the database foundation from Story 1.2, universal filter system from Story 1.3, and comparison system from Story 1.4. It serves as the capstone component integrating all foundation elements.

### Technical Architecture Context
**Primary Revenue Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd.md#functional-requirements]
- Primary "Raised" chart with total revenue amount, donations count, area chart with gradient fill (FR7)
- "First Installments" section with new recurring donor analytics and time-series chart (FR8)
- "One-time donations" section with single gift analytics and visualization (FR9)
- Consistent styling, comparison overlay capabilities, and Daily/Weekly toggle controls

**Three-Section Layout Pattern:** [Source: docs/prd.md#core-screens-and-views]
- Revenue Overview Section: Primary raised/first installments/one-time donations three-panel visualization at dashboard top
- Comprehensive scrollable view containing unified filtering and comparison controls
- Exact duplication of FundraisUP's sophisticated analytics platform interface

**Chart Component Architecture:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#chart-component-pattern]
```typescript
interface RevenueSectionProps {
  initialData: RevenueSectionData;
  comparisonData?: RevenueSectionData;
  granularity: 'daily' | 'weekly';
  isLoading: boolean;
}

// Three-section dashboard structure
<PrimaryRevenueDashboard>
  <TotalRaisedSection />
  <FirstInstallmentsSection />
  <OneTimeDonationsSection />
</PrimaryRevenueDashboard>
```

### Database Query Logic Context
**Revenue Calculation Logic:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#calculated-fields-and-query-helpers]
```sql
-- Total Raised (includes first installments + one-time)
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM pw_transactions
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND (freq = 0 OR (freq = 1 AND order_id NOT REGEXP '_'))
  AND donation_date BETWEEN ? AND ?

-- First Installments Only
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM pw_transactions
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND freq = 1
  AND order_id NOT REGEXP '_'
  AND donation_date BETWEEN ? AND ?

-- One-time Donations Only
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM pw_transactions
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND freq = 0
  AND donation_date BETWEEN ? AND ?
```

**Query Collaboration Workflow:** [Source: docs/prd.md#query-collaboration-process]
1. Development agent requests specific queries for each revenue section
2. User provides base SQL queries working with existing phpMySQL database
3. Agent optimizes queries for Sequelize ORM with universal filtering
4. Validation cycle ensuring data accuracy and performance requirements

### Visual Design Context
**FundraisUP Styling Replication:** [Source: docs/prd.md#branding]
- Exact FundraisUP styling: blue gradients, white backgrounds, gray borders
- Green/red indicators for growth/decline
- Identical typography hierarchy using Inter font family
- Blue gradient area charts matching reference design specifications

**Responsive Grid Implementation:**
```typescript
// Tailwind responsive grid classes
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mb-8">
  <TotalRaisedSection />
  <FirstInstallmentsSection />
  <OneTimeDonationsSection />
</div>
```

### API Endpoints and Data Structure
**Primary Revenue API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/total-raised` - Combined revenue with breakdown
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/first-installments` - New recurring donor revenue
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/one-time-donations` - Single gift analytics

**Enhanced API Response Structure:**
```typescript
interface RevenueSectionResponse {
  data: {
    currentPeriod: {
      totalAmount: number;
      donationCount: number;
      averageDonation: number;
    };
    comparisonPeriod?: {
      totalAmount: number;
      donationCount: number;
      averageDonation: number;
    };
    trendData: Array<{
      period: string; // Date or week identifier
      amount: number;
      count: number;
    }>;
    growth?: {
      amount: number;
      percentage: number;
      direction: 'up' | 'down';
    };
  };
  meta: {
    granularity: 'daily' | 'weekly';
    cached: boolean;
    lastUpdated: string;
  };
}
```

### Recharts Configuration Context
**Area Chart Implementation:**
```typescript
// Shared area chart configuration
const areaChartConfig = {
  margin: { top: 10, right: 30, left: 0, bottom: 0 },
  gradient: {
    id: 'revenueGradient',
    colors: ['#3b82f6', '#1d4ed8'],
    stops: [
      { offset: '0%', stopColor: '#3b82f6', stopOpacity: 0.8 },
      { offset: '100%', stopColor: '#1d4ed8', stopOpacity: 0.1 }
    ]
  }
};

// Recharts area chart component
<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={200}>
  <AreaChart data={trendData} {...areaChartConfig}>
    <defs>
      <linearGradient id="revenueGradient" x1="0" y1="0" x2="0" y2="1">
        <stop offset="0%" stopColor="#3b82f6" stopOpacity={0.8}/>
        <stop offset="100%" stopColor="#1d4ed8" stopOpacity={0.1}/>
      </linearGradient>
    </defs>
    <Area
      type="monotone"
      dataKey="amount"
      stroke="#3b82f6"
      fillOpacity={1}
      fill="url(#revenueGradient)"
    />
    <XAxis dataKey="period" axisLine={false} tickLine={false} />
    <YAxis hide />
    <Tooltip formatter={(value) => [`$${value.toLocaleString()}`, 'Amount']} />
  </AreaChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

### Performance Optimization Context
**Dashboard Performance Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements]
- Dashboard load times must be under 3 seconds for all visualizations
- Support concurrent usage without performance degradation
- Optimized database connection pooling for handling multiple simultaneous chart data requests

**Data Fetching Optimization:**
```typescript
// Shared data fetching for all three sections
const usePrimaryRevenueDashboard = (filters: FilterState) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['primary-revenue', filters],
    queryFn: async () => {
      // Parallel API calls for all three sections
      const [totalRaised, firstInstallments, oneTime] = await Promise.all([
        fetch('/api/v1/analytics/total-raised?' + params).then(r => r.json()),
        fetch('/api/v1/analytics/first-installments?' + params).then(r => r.json()),
        fetch('/api/v1/analytics/one-time-donations?' + params).then(r => r.json())
      ]);

      return { totalRaised, firstInstallments, oneTime };
    },
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  });
};
```

### Integration with Previous Stories
**Filter Integration (Story 1.3):**
```typescript
// All three sections respond to global filter changes
const { dateRange, selectedAppeal, selectedFund, frequency } = useFilterStore();

// Filter parameters applied to all revenue queries
const queryParams = {
  startDate: dateRange.startDate.toISOString(),
  endDate: dateRange.endDate.toISOString(),
  appealId: selectedAppeal?.id,
  fundId: selectedFund?.id,
  frequency: frequency,
  granularity: viewGranularity
};
```

**Comparison Integration (Story 1.4):**
```typescript
// Each section supports individual comparison toggles
const totalRaisedComparison = useComparisonStore(state =>
  state.getChartComparison('total-raised')
);

// Comparison data fetching and display
if (totalRaisedComparison?.enabled) {
  const comparisonParams = {
    ...baseParams,
    compareStartDate: totalRaisedComparison.startDate,
    compareEndDate: totalRaisedComparison.endDate
  };
}
```
