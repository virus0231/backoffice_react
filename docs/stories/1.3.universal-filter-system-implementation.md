# Story 1.3: Universal Filter System Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** fundraising analyst,
**I want** comprehensive filtering controls that affect all dashboard charts simultaneously,
**so that** I can analyze specific time periods, campaigns, and donation types across the entire dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Date range picker with preset options (Today, Yesterday, Last 7/14/30 days, This week/month/year)
2. Appeals dropdown populated from database with dynamic options
3. Funds dropdown with cascading logic based on selected appeals
4. Frequency filter with options: All donations, One-time, Recurring, Recurring (first installments), Recurring (next installments)
5. Filter state management using Zustand with persistence across page refreshes
6. Filter validation preventing invalid date ranges and ensuring logical combinations
7. Global filter context available to all chart components

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story Dependencies:** This story requires the database connection and models established in Story 1.2, and builds on the project foundation from Story 1.1.

### Technical Architecture Context
**Filter System Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd.md#functional-requirements]
- Universal date filter system with dropdown options (FR1)
- Cascading filter logic where Appeals dropdown populates campaigns, Funds updates based on appeals (FR2)
- Frequency filter with specific options: All, One-time, Recurring, Recurring (first/next installments) (FR3)
- Smart date validation preventing overlapping selections (FR5)

**State Management Pattern:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#state-management-with-zustand]
```typescript
interface FilterState {
  dateRange: DateRange;
  selectedCampaign: Campaign | null;
  selectedFund: Fund | null;
  frequency: FrequencyType;
  comparisonPeriod: DateRange | null;

  // Actions
  setDateRange: (range: DateRange) => void;
  setCampaign: (campaign: Campaign | null) => void;
  setFund: (fund: Fund | null) => void;
  setFrequency: (frequency: FrequencyType) => void;
  clearAllFilters: () => void;
}
```

**Filter UI Architecture:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#component-hierarchy]
```
FilterBar (Client Component)
├── DateRangePicker (Client Component)
├── CampaignSelector (Client Component)  // Appeals
├── FundSelector (Client Component)      // Funds
└── FrequencySelector (Client Component)
```

### Database Integration Context
**Filter Data Sources:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#core-data-entities]
- Appeals: `pw_appeal` table with `appeal_name`, `status`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- Funds: `pw_fundlist` table with `fund_name`, `is_active`, related to appeals
- Frequency logic: `pw_transactions.freq` field with specific patterns

**Query Logic for Frequency Filtering:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#calculated-fields-and-query-helpers]
- All donations: No frequency filter applied
- One-time donations: `freq = 0`
- Recurring donations: `freq > 0`
- First installments: `freq = 1 AND order_id NOT REGEXP '_'`
- Next installments: `freq > 1 OR (freq = 1 AND order_id REGEXP '_')`

**API Endpoints for Filter Data:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#filter-data-endpoints]
- `GET /api/v1/filters/campaigns` - Available campaigns for dropdown
- `GET /api/v1/filters/funds` - Available funds with appeal-based filtering
- `GET /api/v1/filters/date-ranges` - Predefined date ranges

### Component Implementation Patterns
**DateRangePicker Implementation:**
```typescript
interface DateRange {
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  preset?: 'today' | 'yesterday' | 'last7days' | 'last30days' | 'thisWeek' | 'thisMonth' | 'thisYear' | 'custom';
}

const presetOptions = [
  { label: 'Today', value: 'today', range: () => ({ startDate: startOfToday(), endDate: endOfToday() }) },
  { label: 'Yesterday', value: 'yesterday', range: () => ({ startDate: startOfYesterday(), endDate: endOfYesterday() }) },
  { label: 'Last 7 Days', value: 'last7days', range: () => ({ startDate: subDays(new Date(), 7), endDate: new Date() }) },
  // ... additional presets
];
```

**Cascading Filter Logic:**
```typescript
// When appeal selection changes, update available funds
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedAppeal) {
    fetchFundsForAppeal(selectedAppeal.id);
  } else {
    fetchAllFunds();
  }
}, [selectedAppeal]);
```

### Tailwind Styling Context
**Filter Component Styling:** [Source: docs/architecture.md#tailwind-configuration]
- Primary colors: Blue gradients (#3b82f6, #2563eb, #1d4ed8)
- Form components: Using @tailwindcss/forms for consistent styling
- Responsive breakpoints including xs: 475px for mobile support
- Inter font family for consistent typography

### File Locations and Naming Conventions
**Filter Component Files:**
- `apps/web/components/filters/DateRangePicker.tsx` - Date range selection
- `apps/web/components/filters/AppealsFilter.tsx` - Campaign/appeal dropdown
- `apps/web/components/filters/FundsFilter.tsx` - Fund selection dropdown
- `apps/web/components/filters/FrequencyFilter.tsx` - Donation frequency selector
- `apps/web/components/filters/FilterBar.tsx` - Combined filter interface

**State Management Files:**
- `apps/web/stores/filterStore.ts` - Zustand filter state store
- `apps/web/providers/FilterProvider.tsx` - Filter context provider
- `apps/web/hooks/useFilters.ts` - Filter context hook

**API Route Files:**
- `apps/web/app/api/v1/filters/campaigns/route.ts` - Appeals data endpoint
- `apps/web/app/api/v1/filters/funds/route.ts` - Funds data endpoint

**Utility Files:**
- `apps/web/lib/validation/filters.ts` - Filter validation utilities
- `apps/web/lib/utils/dateHelpers.ts` - Date manipulation utilities
- `packages/shared/types/filters.ts` - Filter TypeScript interfaces

### Performance Optimization Context
**Filter Performance Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements]
- Dashboard load times must be under 3 seconds for all visualizations
- Support concurrent usage without performance degradation
- Optimized database connection pooling for handling multiple simultaneous requests

**Caching Strategy for Filter Data:**
```typescript
// Filter data caching: 1-hour cache for dropdowns
response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=3600');

// State persistence with localStorage
const persistedState = {
  dateRange: filterState.dateRange,
  selectedAppeal: filterState.selectedAppeal,
  selectedFund: filterState.selectedFund,
  frequency: filterState.frequency
};
```

### Filter Integration with Charts
**Chart Component Integration:**
```typescript
// Example usage in chart components
const { dateRange, selectedAppeal, selectedFund, frequency } = useFilterStore();

const { data, isLoading, error } = useDashboardQuery({
  endpoint: '/api/v1/analytics/total-raised',
  params: {
    startDate: dateRange.startDate.toISOString(),
    endDate: dateRange.endDate.toISOString(),
    appealId: selectedAppeal?.id,
    fundId: selectedFund?.id,
    frequency: frequency
  }
});
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards [Source: docs/architecture.md#technology-stack-table]

- Validation logic tests for date ranges and filter combinations

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Date range picker component functionality and preset options
- Appeals dropdown population and search capabilities
- Funds dropdown cascading logic based on appeal selection
- Frequency filter option selection and database query mapping
- Filter state persistence across browser sessions
- Filter validation preventing invalid combinations
- Global filter context availability in chart components
