## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
- Query collaboration workflow documentation - Need specific process for how dev agent requests and receives queries from user
- First Epic foundation completeness - Ensure all infrastructure is established in Epic 1

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- Export format specifications - Define exact export formats and professional report templates
- Performance benchmarking criteria - Establish specific measurement approaches for 3-second load target

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Appropriately Scoped:**
- 15+ chart types represent exact FundraisUP replication requirement
- 5-epic structure provides logical development progression
- Each epic delivers standalone deployable value

**Timeline Realism:**
- Aggressive 2-week timeline requires full dedication but achievable with:
  - User-provided queries reducing database discovery time
  - Recharts library selection accelerating chart development
  - AI development assistance for rapid prototyping

## Technical Readiness

**Well-Defined:**
- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Recharts technology stack confirmed
- Multi-level caching architecture planned
- Database integration approach with user query collaboration
- Performance optimization strategy outlined

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**
- Specific Recharts component implementation for heatmap visualizations
- Complex comparison period calculation optimization
- Real-time data update mechanisms

## Recommendations

1. **Document Query Collaboration Process** - Create specific template for how dev agent requests queries and receives optimization guidance
2. **Export Template Design** - Define professional report formats matching organizational branding
3. **Performance Monitoring Setup** - Plan specific performance measurement and optimization approach

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The requirements provide clear direction for exact FundraisUP replication with appropriate technical constraints and development sequencing.
