# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a comprehensive fundraising analytics dashboard that transforms raw database data into actionable insights for nonprofit decision-making
- Achieve exact visual and functional replication of the FundraisUP insights interface with advanced filtering and comparison capabilities
- Reduce data analysis time by 75% and enable real-time campaign adjustments instead of waiting for monthly reports
- Establish 100% stakeholder adoption within 3 months across development teams and leadership
- Eliminate manual reporting overhead by replacing spreadsheet-based workflows with automated dashboard insights

## Background Context

The organization currently has valuable fundraising data locked in a phpMySQL database without meaningful visualization or analytical capabilities. Development teams and leadership rely on manual queries, basic reports, and spreadsheet compilation, creating significant inefficiencies and missed opportunities for data-driven optimization.

This project addresses the critical gap between raw data availability and actionable insights by building a custom web-based dashboard that connects directly to existing infrastructure. The solution will replicate sophisticated analytics capabilities seen in commercial platforms while maintaining complete ownership and control of data and functionality.
